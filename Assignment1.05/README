This week I added functionality that allowed for the player to be moved according to a series of keys provided in the spec. 
The plater can traverse through multiple floors, can no longer tunnel, and is killed when a monster gets to him first. 
The Q button when held for a little while quits the game.
The game is now rendered in ncurses.
