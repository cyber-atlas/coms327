For this project, I was able to successfully parse the information. I didn't know whether
I was supposed to actually "roll" the dice, so I did write code for that in main, but
commented it out.

I parsed everything in main. So, since I'm using the professor's code, you'll have to
quit out of the game and the parsed values will appear above the crown/grave display.
I didn't know how to remove that from main without throwing all kinds of errors.

All the values that are parsed and printed are exactly as the txt document has them.
Only the values are printed though. Not the tags like "NAME", "SYMBOL", etc...
