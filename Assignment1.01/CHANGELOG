    Was able to clean up the code ALOT. Rooms no longer touch and the corridor function works. Implmented this by creating a border around each room and removing it in printer.

    Have been working on getting the corridors to work properly. Rewrote the function and it did not work, reverting for now.

    Rewrote adder and checker, and debugged. Code works now, however corridors are turned off and the rooms may be made adjacent still.

    Added checker, roomAdder, and changed some logic. Getting a seg fault, and corridor function. Still getting a seg fault.
